# Final Project

![image](http://geekwisdom.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/calvin-and-hobbes.gif)

It's time to go out and build something. As always, project week will be a sprint, and doesn't end on the final day. Keep that in mind, and keep your MVP focused!

Our advice is this:

> Either make something you've been wanting to make
> for a while, or integrate something new that you're
> curious about. That will keep you on track to
> work at a regular pace and making something
> worthwhile *in the long run*!

## Project Objectives

1. Write code you want people to read,
-  build something nice and small (not a sprawling mess, but a real **MVP**),
-  build something with potential to grow (so that you can continue adding features to it),
-  manage your time well (remember: this is a test-run for your life post-course!), and
-  most importantly, ***explore an area or technology that interests you!***

## Requirements

- __Application__
    - has a public GitHub repo with comprehensive README documentation (see below).
    - follows a style (you can use Rubocop and jsHint, but at least stick to a consistent style and defend it),
    - follows the principles of good software:
      - (1) semantic **naming**,
      - (2) **small** procedures and classes,
      - (3) a **DRY** structure (no-repeated code),
      - (4) **tests** (specifications) where applicable,
      - consistent style (see above),
      - readable or commented (as necessary), and
    - is deployed.
- __Indidivual__
    - present your work and describe why you created it, eg:
      1. *"It's an area or project of interest to me - this is a proof of concept."*
      2. *"I wanted to use this technology and learn how it works... This is an experiment."*

## Deliverables (Due on Thursday, October 30th, 9am)

- An application with documentation that includes:
    - link to the deployed app,
    - a short description,
    - a list of technologies used (with appropriate links), and
    - artifacts:
      - wireframes, and an
      - ERD (if applicable).
- A 5 minute Lightning talk that:
    - Demos your application.
