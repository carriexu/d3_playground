For your final project you'll be working alone, but that doesn't mean you won't be scrumming!  Your scrum group is there to provide support and accountability!

From 9am to 9:15am you'll meet in the following groups to go over:

- What you did yesterday
- What you're going to do today
- Any roadblocks for the day
